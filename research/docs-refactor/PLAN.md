# HyperFrames documentation refactor

## Current approval gate

Approved by the product owner on 2026-07-29. Public implementation is complete
and ready for review.

The product owner refined the information model on 2026-07-30. Four maturity
journeys are now the canonical front doors:

1. **Understand HyperFrames** — `/introduction`
2. **Create a first video** — `/quickstart`
3. **Go further** — `/go-further`
4. **Build on HyperFrames** — `/developers`

Workflows, Studio, Catalog, export, and troubleshooting are destinations inside
these journeys rather than competing front doors.

The approved journeys become the source of truth for:

- canonical starting links;
- page priority and order;
- required videos and diagrams;
- navigation;
- consolidation and removal decisions;
- analytics and usability tests.

The route-to-journey contract is maintained in `JOURNEY-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`.

Status: four-journey page rebuild and film production complete
Started: 2026-07-28
Primary audience: people who want to make, edit, and share videos with HyperFrames
Secondary audience: developers integrating or extending HyperFrames

This is the durable plan for the documentation refactor. Read it before doing docs work, including after a chat compaction or in a future session.

## Goal

Turn the docs from a repository-shaped collection of pages into a useful product guide.

A visitor should quickly understand:

- what HyperFrames does;
- whether they should use an agent, Studio, or both;
- how to complete a real video task;
- where to find a feature they saw in the product;
- what to send someone who asks “how do I do this?”;
- where technical reference lives when they actually need it.

The docs should feel clear, capable, visual, and human. They should not read like an API dump, marketing filler, or instructions written only for framework contributors.

## Current journey rebuild

The four canonical journey pages are being rebuilt as complete front doors:

1. `/introduction` — understand HyperFrames;
2. `/quickstart` — create a first video;
3. `/go-further` — gain more control;
4. `/developers` — build on HyperFrames.

Each page begins with one complete narrated film and continues with a concise
written expansion. The shared film series uses River narration, burned phrase
captions, an intentional music arc, purposeful SFX, real product behavior, and
real HyperFrames source. Long films use controls and do not autoplay or loop.

The approved Mintlify header, left sidebar, right table of contents, theme, and
page-width behavior remain unchanged.

## Navigation decision

Use four top-level header tabs:

1. **Guides** — start here, create with an agent, workflows, core ideas, media, export, troubleshooting, and product updates.
2. **Studio** — the complete visual editor manual.
3. **Catalog** — browsable blocks and components.
4. **Developers** — CLI, SDK, packages, schemas, deployment, integrations, and contributing.

Global header:

- Use Mintlify’s **Aspen** theme. A desktop and mobile preview confirmed that it provides the desired full-width header without custom CSS.
- HyperFrames logo on the left.
- Search remains prominent.
- GitHub link on the right.
- Light/dark theme toggle remains available.
- Primary **Playground** action to the official `hyperframes.dev` browser experience. Studio itself remains project-local through `npx hyperframes preview`.
- Keep Aspen’s full-width top navigation. Use the small desktop-only layout override needed to fit the logo, tabs, search, actions, and theme toggle on one row.
- Keep every left-sidebar group open and non-collapsible. Match the deployed main docs' spacing, group-heading scale, square link treatment, and segmented active-page rail.
- Keep Mintlify’s default right-side **On this page** behavior and styling.
- Align Aspen's sticky sidebar to the actual 56px header, remove its premature scroll fade, keep the GitHub star count, and use main's quieter structural border color.
- Keep the floating agent input easy to notice without making it visually dominant.

Navigation behavior:

- Every tab uses ordinary top-level groups, matching `origin/main`.
- Group labels are static section headings; only actual pages navigate.
- Do not add `root`, `directory`, `expanded`, or drilldown behavior.
- Keep Mintlify's default sidebar and **On this page** rendering unchanged.
- Human-facing labels describe tasks, not repository packages.
- Updates is not a top-level tab.

## Target information architecture

### Guides

- Start here
  - What HyperFrames is
  - Make your first video
  - Go further
  - Build on HyperFrames
- Create with an agent
  - Choose a workflow
  - Give the agent a useful brief
  - Review and improve a result
  - Product and website videos
  - Explainers
  - PR and changelog videos
  - Captions and talking-head recuts
  - Motion graphics
  - Music-driven videos
  - Slideshows
- Learn
  - Composition basics
  - Timing and tracks
  - Animation basics
  - Reusable variables
  - Nested compositions
  - Deterministic rendering
- Media
  - Images and video
  - Voice and audio
  - Captions and transcription
  - Background removal
  - Color grading
- Export and share
  - Choose a format
  - Export from Studio
  - Render from the CLI
  - 4K and HDR
  - Publish and share
- Help
  - Troubleshooting
  - Common questions
  - Give feedback
- What’s new
  - Product updates
  - Detailed release archive

### Studio

- Studio overview and tour
- Storyboard
- Canvas editing
- Layers and groups
- Timeline editing
- Animation and keyframes
- Assets and reusable blocks
- Text, layout, style, media, 3D, and color controls
- Captions
- Variables and templates
- Slideshows
- Source editor
- Lint and fixing issues
- Export queue
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Troubleshooting

### Catalog

- Visual catalog home
- Blocks
- Components
- Categories and search
- Add an item
- Customize an item
- Build and contribute an item

Individual item pages stay concise and visual. Their shared generator owns the agent prompt, install path, and progressive disclosure of technical details.

### Developers

- Developer overview
- CLI
- SDK
- Player
- Packages
- HTML schema
- Advanced rendering
- Deployment
- MCP and integrations
- Contributing
- Release process

## Content decisions

- Rewrite Introduction and Quickstart around outcomes and user paths.
- Create real Studio documentation from current product behavior.
- Move user-facing Studio material out of Contributing.
- Merge Packages, SDK, and Reference into Developers.
- Remove Weekly updates until it has real content and an owner.
- Keep one human-readable product updates page and one detailed release archive.
- Merge Showcase and Launch Videos into one examples area.
- Merge overlapping Claude Design and Open Design guidance.
- Replace the stale Website to Video workflow with the current Product Launch workflow.
- Merge Common Mistakes into a useful troubleshooting hub.
- Replace the giant CLI wall with task guides plus a searchable command reference.
- Add the MCP guide to navigation.
- Correct installation guidance:
  - Agent/non-interactive default: `npx hyperframes skills update`
  - Interactive picker: `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --full-depth`

## Writing principles

- Lead with the result, not setup.
- Use “you” and name visible controls exactly as they appear.
- One page, one main job.
- Prefer short sentences and meaningful headings.
- Show a successful path before edge cases.
- Explain technical vocabulary the first time it appears.
- Do not make humans learn internal architecture unless it helps them act.
- Do not hide important caveats.
- No filler introductions, fake enthusiasm, or repetitive summaries.
- Use screenshots, short clips, diagrams, and examples when they reduce uncertainty.
- Technical detail belongs in a Developer section or a clearly labeled advanced section.

## Evidence standard

Every feature claim must come from at least one current source:

- shipped product code;
- tests;
- CLI help/output;
- schemas and public types;
- current agent skills;
- a confirmed live product flow.

Old docs and changelogs are leads, not proof.
